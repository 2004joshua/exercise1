# EC530 HW1 

### Descriptions

For this code, I utilized C++ to create an algorithm to solve for the shortest distance between two array of points. I used the Haversine formula
since the elements in boths arrays are gps locations and currently it supports calculating if the inputs are in lat lon format. 

Haversine Formula: d = 2R * arcsin(sqrt(sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * sin²(Δλ/2)))
